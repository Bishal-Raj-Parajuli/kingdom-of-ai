# Kingdom of AI

## Project Concept

Kingdom of AI is an innovative game that simulates the management of a kingdom through the interaction of three AI agents. This project explores the potential of AI in game design and decision-making processes.

### Core Concept

The game revolves around three key components:

1. **Population**: The number of people in the kingdom
2. **Happiness**: The overall satisfaction of the population
3. **Gold**: The wealth of the kingdom

These resources are managed and influenced by three AI agents:

1. **Game Agent**: Acts as the game engine, evaluating decisions and updating the kingdom's state.
2. **People Agent**: Generates questions and scenarios for the king to address.
3. **King Agent**: Makes decisions (yes/no) based on the presented questions.

## Game Flow

1. The People Agent generates a question or scenario.
2. The King Agent analyzes the situation and makes a yes/no decision.
3. The Game Agent evaluates the decision and updates the kingdom's resources accordingly.
4. This process repeats until a game-over condition is met.

## Technical Implementation

### Backend

- Node.js with TypeScript
- WebSocket for real-time communication

### Frontend

- React for user interface

### AI Integration

- Gemini-flash 2.0 for AI functionality
- Letta for agent memory management

## Project Goals

1. Create a simple yet engaging game that demonstrates AI decision-making.
2. Explore the potential of AI agents in game design and simulation.
3. Provide a foundation for future expansions and more complex AI interactions.

## Future Directions

- Implement more sophisticated AI decision-making algorithms
- Introduce complex scenarios and long-term consequences
- Develop a graphical user interface for enhanced user experience
- Add multiplayer functionality for human vs. AI gameplay
